\usage{
leiden_find_partition(igraph,
  partition_type = c("RBConfigurationVertexPartition",
  "CPMVertexPartition", "ModularityVertexPartition", "RBERVertexPartition",
  "SignificanceVertexPartition", "SurpriseVertexPartition"),
  initial_membership = NULL, edge_weights = NULL, node_sizes = NULL,
  seed = NULL, resolution_parameter = 0.5, num_iter = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{igraph}{R igraph graph.}

\item{partition_type}{String partition type name.}

\item{initial_membership}{Numeric vector of initial membership
assignments of nodes. These are 1-based indices. Default is one
community per node.}

\item{edge_weights}{Numeric vector of edge weights. Default is 1.0 for
all edges.}

\item{node_sizes}{Numeric vector of node sizes. Default is 1 for all
nodes.}

\item{seed}{Numeric random number generator seed. The seed value must be
either NULL for random seed values or greater than 0 for a fixed seed
value. Default is NULL.}

\item{resolution_parameter}{Numeric resolution parameter. The value
must be greater than 0.0. Default is 0.5.}

\item{num_iter}{Numeric number of iterations. Default is 2.}
}
\value{
A named list consisting of a numeric vector of the node
 memberships (1-based indices), a numeric quality value, a numeric
 vector of edge weights within each community, a numeric vector of
 edge weights from each community, a numeric vector of edge weights
 to each community, total edge weight, and a numeric vector of
 individual community modularities.

\description{
R to C wrapper that runs the basic Leiden community detection algorithm,
which is similar to the find_partition() function in the python Leidenalg distribution.
}
\details{
The Leiden algorithm is described in

Notes from leidenalg/src/VertexPartition.py
\itemize{
  \item \emph{ CPMVertexPartition }
        Implements CPM. 
        This quality function is well-defined for both positive and negative edge weights.
        This quality function uses a linear resolution parameter.
  \item \emph{ ModularityVertexPartition }
        Implements modularity. 
        This quality function is well-defined only for positive edge weights.
  \item\emph{  RBConfigurationVertexPartition }
        Implements Reichardt and Bornholdt’s Potts model with a configuration null model. 
        This quality function is well-defined only for positive edge weights.
        This quality function uses a linear resolution parameter.
  \item \emph{ RBERVertexPartition }
        Implements Reichardt and Bornholdt’s Potts model with an Erdos-Renyi null model.
        This quality function is well-defined only for positive edge weights.
        This quality function uses a linear resolution parameter.
  \item \emph{ SignificanceVertexPartition }
        Implements Significance. 
        This quality function is well-defined only for unweighted graphs.
  \item \emph{ SurpriseVertexPartition }
        Implements (asymptotic) Surprise.
        This quality function is well-defined only for positive edge weights.
